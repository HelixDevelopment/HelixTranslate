Create me now a full report of unfinished stuff and the detailed step by step plan in phases on how to implement everything, cover it with
all supported test types (5-6 types we support and our tests bank framework), having complete project documentation, full step by step user
manuals, extended and update video courses, extended and updated video courses and finally completely upodated content of the website
(located in Website directory).
No module, application, library, test can stay broken or disabled or with no 100% tests coverage and full documentation!
Make sure that you do not start any interactive process during your work which may for example request root or sudo password.
